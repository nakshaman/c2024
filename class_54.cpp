        it is also called early binding
        compile time polymorphism in c++ is achieved through
            1.1 function overloading
            1.2 opertor overloading
        2. run time polymorphism
        it is also called late binding
        run time polymorphism in c++ is achieved through
            2.1 virtual functions
